Crashes can be handled in the following way:
1. Using crontab to poll a script which checks if phant is running or not & starts phant if not running.
2. Using Forever module to start phant, i.e. forever phant
3. Using the concept of parent & child process. 
	E.g:
until '/usr/local/bin/phant 2>&1 | logger'; do
    echo "Server 'phant' crashed with exit code $?.  Respawning.." >&2
    sleep 1
done
